### Java & Selenium Bing Rewards Automation

This project is a fully automated solution developed in **Java** using **Selenium WebDriver** to collect daily search points from the Microsoft Bing Rewards program.

It efficiently simulates human search behavior to accumulate points for both **Desktop (PC)** and **Mobile** searches, utilizing TestNG to manage separate execution groups for maximized daily rewards.

#### Technologies Used:
* **Language:** Java (JDK)
* **Web Automation:** Selenium WebDriver (for browser control and emulation)
* **Test Runner/Framework:** TestNG (for grouping and running Desktop/Mobile tests)
* **Build Tool:** Maven (or direct dependency injection)






#### Personal Context:
Developed as a practical exercise while learning Java programming, this project demonstrates proficiency in setting up a robust automation environment. **As a 1st-year Software Engineering student at İzmir Ekonomi Üniversitesi (IEU)**
