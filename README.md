### Java & Selenium Bing Rewards Automation

This project is a fully automated solution developed in **Java** using **Selenium WebDriver** to collect daily search points from the Microsoft Bing Rewards program.

It efficiently simulates human search behavior to accumulate points for both **Desktop** and **Mobile** searches, utilizing TestNG to manage separate execution groups for maximized daily rewards.

#### Technologies Used:
* **Language:** Java (JDK)
* **Web Automation:** Selenium WebDriver (for browser control and emulation)
* **Test Runner/Framework:** TestNG (for grouping and running Desktop/Mobile tests)
* **Build Tool:** Maven (or direct dependency injection)


#### Personal Context:
Developed as a practical exercise while learning Java programming, this project demonstrates proficiency in setting up a robust automation environment. **As a 1st-year Software Engineering student.**


### Note on AI Assistance and Learning

This project was developed with the assistance of an AI large language model (LLM) to accelerate the initial setup and code structure, particularly concerning complex library configurations (Selenium, TestNG) and the necessary Git commands.

But, every(almost) line of code and every technical concept was thoroughly researched, understood, and manually verified to ensure full comprehension of the automation flow, class structure, and TestNG annotations. This approach was used as a learning accelerator, not a shortcut, demonstrating dedication to mastering these tools as a new Software Engineering student.  (May give up on testNG and try to learn Junit, it is more known they say)
